# BLACKJACK

### GAME LINK

### OBJECTIVE
The objective is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over 21 versus the dealer. At the start of a Blackjack game, the player and the dealer receive two cards each.

### INSTRUCTIONS
- The game is very straight forward. Click "DEAL" to start a game, and the dealer and player will both be dealt 2 cards each.
- Card sum and wins are notated in the black bars and will adjust whenever an extra card is dealt or a game is won.
- If you are not content with your hand total, click "HIT" to get an extra card. Be careful not to exceed 21 or you will automatically lose.
- Once you are ready to check the dealer's card, click "STAND". Dealer will automatically be dealt cards until points are 17 or higher.
- The higher total is the winner. If score is the same, then it's a TIE or PUSH.
- If you get a BLACKJACK or 21 in your opening hand, you will still need to click "STAND" to check the dealer's hand as it might be a tie.
